# Self-Balancing-bot-using-LQR
A self balancing bot using Linear Quadratic Regulator
First calculate K matrix using MATLAB code by putting your robot's parameters and the replace that K matrix in the code.
Fix value of R as unity and then change weights of Q matrix accorindly.
Weights corresponding to angle and angular velocity must be highest.
